<h2>About Us:</h2>
<img src="Machint/Rajesh Sanakayala.jpg" alt="New York" width="400" height="220">
Machint Solutions was founded by Rajesh Sanakkayala in 2018. It all started off with Rajesh partnering a small technology house in India, that focussed on resource based consulting services. The initial idea was to nurture his entrepreneurial ideas to help grow business for them. However the bigger scene appeared when they all realised that there is a significant demand for process management and automation solutions in the market from the advisory and development perspective. This exactly synced with the passion filled desire that Rajesh always had to build a brand new niche technology expertise. As a result, by late 2018, the firm got re-branded as a comprehensive technology solutions provider with a robust Intelligent Automation technologies portfolio under the name of Machint Solutions, headquartered at HITEC City, Hyderabad.

Human Resources department in general seems to be the least understood in many senses, as most say it’s just about paperwork and maintaining employee records. The most ironic part is that the HR personnel are regarded.
